# VTRAN vector converter review

## The Bottom Line



## Trip Report

### Off to a Rough Start

I'm pretty excited about VTRAN's website. They let you [download the software](http://www.sourceiii.com/support.php#downloads) and [download the user's manual](http://www.sourceiii.com/files/vtran/vtran_man.pdf) right from [the VTRAN product page](http://www.sourceiii.com/product-vtran.php)

Source III provides a nice little 
[form for requesting evaluation keys](http://www.sourceiii.com/support.php#evaluation-keys).
Unfortunately, the first time I filled it out, it gave me this friendly, though
unhelpful response:

![vtran-error](/images/vtran-sorry-you-have-faced-an-error.png)

I think it's a little too aggressive in validating my FLEXnet host ID. I had
entered my wlan Ethernet address. After deleting some colons I was joyous to
see:

![vtran-thank-you](/images/vtran-thank-you-for-your-interest.png)

But no evaluation key. I guess it can't be easy. That was 2:30 pm on a Tuesday.
In the meantime, I decided to flip through the user's manual.
