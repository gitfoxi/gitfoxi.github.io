# Handlers

The robot that picks up my device and squishes it against the tester is oft-overlooked technology.

* How do they work?
* What do they cost? Can I afford one for my bedroom?
* How to interface the test head?
* How to interface a System Level Test board?
* What's the cost and effort in interfacing a new package?
* Select time
* Temperature control
* GPIO, GPIB, why not USB or bluetooth? Why not Wifi or ethernet for that matter?
* Number of bins?
* Camera? Labeling?
* User interface? (I'd use an iPad, but they seem to prefer trackballs for some reason.)
* Setup and teardown?
* Reliability?
* How to avoid damaging DUT through squishing or shocking?
* What standards apply?
* Handling large and tiny packages?
* Trays or tubes?
* Testfloor footprint.
* Handle wierd packages like gull-wing -- isn't this more of a socket issue?

Is there any inovative new technology available in 2013? Why do they all seem to come from Japan?
Let's see what we can learn about handlers.

## Thoughts

Features are cool. But remember that every extra bin or extra feature is another thing that can break. Unless you have some extra handlers breakage can shut down production.

You can only put so many handlers on a test floor. Bigger ones have higher throughput. Smaller ones are smaller.
