# Where's hp93k on the Web?

If the hp93k were created today, hopefully they'd give it a better name. I mean,
given the series of companies that's owned it -- HP, Agilent, Verigy and now
Advantest -- and the obtuseness of the search terms **93k**, **hp93k** and **93000**
it's no wonder you can't learn anything about it on the web.

## Let's Make **hp93k** a Search Term

Here's an idea: How about, everyone on the web talking about hp93k
makes liberal use of the term "**hp93k**". Just as a convention, this will give
the search engines a chance to find you now and in the future.

## My New Google Alert

Meanwhile, I'm setting up a Google Alert with the term:

    ("hp93k" OR "hp93000" OR "93k") ("HP" OR "agilent" OR "verigy" OR "advantest") ("github" OR "open source" OR "code" OR "script")
    
Google claims there's 2.7 million results but not much of what I'm looking for:

## Suggestions?

If you've discovered a better way to learn about interesting things people are
doing out in the open (source) with their hp93k on the Internet, let me know in
the comments.
